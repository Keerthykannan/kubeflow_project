"['""Noisy"" data can lead to bad policy decisions — which is why economists are advising caution amid the ongoing wild upswing in retail prices. Even though the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said it stands ready to take further action, surely the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will not increase interest rates on August 10 to counter a jump in inflation driven primarily by vegetable prices?', 'To be fair, the ', "", with some economists seeing the possibility of last month's headline retail inflation, data for which will be released on August 14, having crossed even 7 percent. It is often in times such as these that the RBI has, in the past, taken comfort in core inflation."", ""Core CPI inflation — or inflation excluding food and fuel— has dropped dramatically in the last few months. After being rather sticky at 6 percent-plus, core inflation fell to 5.1 percent in May and stayed there in June. This would have particularly pleased the MPC, whose last two repo rate hikes in December 2022 and February 2023 — totalling 60 basis points — were intended to break the persistence of core inflation. So it would not be a surprise to see the MPC's August 10 statement treat the vegetable price spike as a temporary phenomenon rooted in supply-side issues and instead bask in the withdrawal of core inflation, which is seen as a proxy for underlying price pressures."", '""The RBI is likely to take comfort from the fact that persistence in core inflation has come down a notch and is unlikely to be affected by the increase in perishables food prices,"" Rahul Bajoria, managing director and head of emerging markets Asia (ex-China) economics at Barclays, said in a note on August 1.', 'The problem, however, lies in the reliability of core inflation as a measure of underlying price changes.', 'The issues with the CPI are well known and were further highlighted earlier this year when the ', 'due to a tweak in the methodology.', 'The entire basket of goods and services is also severely outdated due to the government junking the results of the 2017-18 edition of the Consumer Expenditure Survey, which is the basis for making wholesale revisions to the CPI series.', 'If the CPI suffers from issues, core CPI will too, as it is merely a subset of the former. The four groups it is made up of account for 47.3 percent of the CPI. And one of these—housing, which makes up 10 percent of the entire CPI basket and 21 percent of core CPI—suffers from huge measurement issues.', 'CPI housing inflation in June was only 4.56 percent. In fact, it has been under 5 percent for more than four years but anyone who has tried to rent a home in the last year or so will think this is a cruel joke.', 'According to property portal ', ', the all-India average rental rate was 15.3 percent higher in the first three months of 2023 compared to January-March 2022. Meanwhile, housing inflation as per the CPI averaged 4.8 percent in January-March 2023.', 'How is the CPI underestimating housing—and, therefore, core—inflation? The problem lies with the methodology. As much as 1.3 percent of the CPI basket — more than the combined weight of onions and tomatoes — is made up of employer-provided dwellings, mostly by the public sector. And rent for government-provided houses depends on who lives in it and their house rent allowance (HRA).', '""If we measure an increase or decrease in rent when there is a change in the tenant of a privately rented house, then such changes reflect actual movements in market rent. However, the movements in rent of government dwelling due to change in the resident, has no relation to actual change in rental prices,"" an RBI staff paper said in November 2018.', 'Core CPI inflation can change depending on what items are included in it. Economists prefer to refine their definition of core inflation and exclude certain fuels and metals that are included in the ""miscellaneous"" group of the CPI basket. Some also remove the most volatile items within the core and look at a \'trimmed mean\' measure.', 'While these measures may have their merits, they do not solve the methodology issues with housing.', 'This, however, will not stop the MPC from seeking refuge in core inflation on August 10. After all, the rate-setting panel must work with what is available. To be fair to the committee, at least one member has bemoaned the outdated nature of the CPI and its impact on monetary policy decision making.', '""The index needs to be updated as quickly as possible. The MPC has to spend far too much time and effort on prices of various food items that are beyond its influence. I had raised this issue when I joined the MPC but the status quo prevails,"" Ashima Goyal, one of the three external members of the MPC, ', '.', 'All ', '.

Surely the\xa0situation brought about by his invasion of Ukraine and his recurring rattles of the atomic saber must also change how the US thinks about its own atomic strategy. But how exactly?', 'Putin has, over the past 500 days or so, destroyed each of the\xa0', '\xa0that developed during the Cold War to prevent an atomic arms race and Armageddon. First, he’s broken the nuclear taboo, by casually threatening the use of such diabolical weapons. Second, he’s undermined the consensus against nuclear proliferation, by demonstrating that foregoing nukes —\xa0', '\xa0in the 1990s —\xa0leaves a nation vulnerable to people like him. Third, he’s chipped at the barrier between bad and good uses of fission, by turning the Ukrainian nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, occupied by his troops since last March, into a\xa0', '.', 'Russian television, propaganda, intelligentsia and society have taken their leader’s cue and normalised atomic intimidation, sometimes with apocalyptic hysterics.

The US-led West, Karaganov is sure, won’t dare to retaliate.', 'No matter\xa0that Karaganov\xa0', '\xa0for the Kremlin, or that other Russian voices tried to temper his\xa0', '\xa0logic. What matters is that in the space of a year the tone of\xa0nuclear geopolitics has deteriorated in ways not even the pessimists,\xa0', ', considered possible. This year, Putin also suspended New START, the last remaining arms control treaty between the US and Russia. And he\xa0', '\xa0tactical warheads in his neighboring quasi-vassal state of Belarus.', 'The growing importance of such tactical warheads, designed to win battles rather than incinerate nations,\xa0is what worries me most.\xa0Russia\xa0', '\xa0more than 1,900 tactical nukes, roughly ten times more than the US. (The limitations of the\xa0', '\xa0applied only to longer-range “strategic” nukes.) And those are the weapons Putin has been menacing with. He appears to think that such “limited” nuclear warfare can compensate for his army’s revealed shortcomings in conventional warfare. And he seems to assume that tactical warheads, because they’re smaller, would blur the line at which the US would retaliate with its own nuclear strikes.', 'This assumption is unfathomably dangerous. It’s true that the US and its allies, in order to try to\xa0control escalation spirals, have decided to punish Putin for first use of a tactical nuke “only” with a debilitating\xa0', '\xa0strike against Russian forces, probably those in Ukraine. But Putin or his successors, faced with catastrophic defeat and demise, would then have even more incentive to use additional tactical nukes. How would the West respond to those subsequent strikes, especially if they irradiate, or even hit, NATO territory?', 'The reality —\xa0and the factor that Karaganov willfully\xa0ignored —\xa0is that\xa0game theory cannot reliably\xa0forecast or quantify the risks of escalation once even the first warhead detonates.

Only $6 billion of the $756 billion that the Congressional Budget Office\xa0', '\xa0America will spend over the next decade on upgrading its nuclear forces\xa0is slated to go to tactical weapons, and only $3 billion to their modernisation. That’s after the Biden administration canceled a program to build tactical nukes launched on\xa0cruise missiles from ships. Given what Putin is up to, isn’t that unwise?', 'Not really. That, at least, is the\xa0near-consensus among many in the nuclear know. It’s a mistake to think that enemy powers could trade tactical strikes indefinitely, says Daryl Kimball, head of the Arms Control Association in Washington, DC. The damage would be so devastating so quickly that the conflict would either end or escalate to strategic nukes and Armageddon. So there’s no military rationale for\xa0having more than a few dozen tactical weapons.', 'The distinction between strategic and tactical nukes isn’t helpful, adds Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. The categories were created when the Soviets and Americans started negotiating about arms control during the Cold War, and wanted to include or exclude specific weapons they had. The logic of deterrence instead remains the same no matter the weapon: You need to persuade your adversary that\xa0', '\xa0resort to nuclear warfare will\xa0never succeed and will\xa0be answered with unacceptable destruction.', 'This suggests that the US already has the appropriate strategy for situations such as Putin’s war of aggression and nuclear bluster. It is, first, to maintain\xa0', 'military prowess so overwhelming that Putin could never gain anything from dropping a tactical nuke —\xa0the US would obliterate his forces with non-nuclear firepower. Second, it is to remind Putin that any apocalyptic turn, including\xa0nuclear launches at the West, would be answered in kind. The Cold War logic of “mutual assured destruction” still holds.', 'What complicates the longer-term picture is that\xa0a new arms race is also underway. China, a relatively small nuclear power with\xa0', ', plans to rapidly increase its stockpile to 1,000 this decade, with an ultimate goal of reaching parity with the US and Russia. That doesn’t mean China is a destabilising factor yet. Its president, Xi Jinping, has done\xa0more than anybody else so far to restrain Putin, by telling his nominal “friend”\xa0', '\xa0not to use a nuke, lest he lose Beijing’s support.', 'But China’s ambitions make\xa0arms control, never easy, fiendishly difficult. Even in the previous situation of two nuclear superpowers and seven middling or minor powers, the\xa0', '\xa0of disarmament and nonproliferation negotiations has stretched human cognition to its limits. China joining the US and Russia as an atomic superpower will turn that constellation into a “', '” —\xa0the kind that’s been driving scientists crazy ever since Isaac Newton tried and failed to go from modeling the earth and moon to considering those two and the sun as well.', 'For starters, should the US view Russia and China as separate threats, or potentially as one combined adversary? In that case, America would need to scale up its\xa0arsenal dramatically. That would be economically ruinous. It would also make the Chinese even more paranoid about US intentions, prompting them to accelerate their production.', 'Then there’s the prospect of proliferation. As North Korea adds to its nuclear stockpile, South Koreans become more likely to build their own nukes. If Iran crosses the atomic threshold and makes its own warheads, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and others in the region will eventually follow.', 'The surprising conclusion for the US, nonetheless, is that America already has the right strategy and should stick to it. That, too, is leadership —\xa0not to let wannabe tsars and tin-pot dictators provoke a superpower\xa0into runaway arms races. With the so-called\xa0', '\xa0watching, it behooves Washington to demonstrate that it —\xa0not Beijing or Moscow —\xa0is the responsible actor in world affairs.', 'For purposes of deterring Russia, China and all other adversaries, the US doesn’t actually need all the nukes it already has, Jon Wolfsthal, the nuclear specialist on the National Security Council during the administration of Barack Obama, told me. So “modernisation” is mainly about updating existing systems, from the warheads to the triad of delivery mechanisms on land, at sea and in the air. And that’s about right.', 'Beyond that, the US must signal that it’ll always stay open to negotiations, with Russia, China or any combination of countries. In time, and under different leaders in Moscow and other capitals, these talks could progress to encompass a global nuclear freeze, and eventually even the\xa0', '\xa0of nuclear weapons.', 'Until then, the US is right to deter, with conventional military superiority and the nuclear arsenal it has. Admittedly, even that thought doesn’t provide much comfort. The dirty secret of deterrence is that it works until it fails, and when it fails, it fails spectacularly.', 'Hence the anxiety ever present since\xa01945, when Robert Oppenheimer tested the first atomic bomb. While building it, the scientists worried that the blast might set off a chain reaction that would destroy the whole world, Oppenheimer tells Albert Einstein at the end of the new movie in cinemas now. “What of it?”, asks Einstein. “I believe we did,” replies Oppenheimer.

Most of the IT bellwethers have reported numbers below market expectations. At the same time, companies in the banking and financial services space have declared numbers that have exceeded market expectations.', 'Although it’s too early to take a call on the corporate earnings for the quarter just started, earnings season is unlikely to see any meaningful cuts per se in market expectations for the full year.', 'We believe that the capital goods sector still looks very good. The focus from the Government on the investment side has picked up momentum. Public capex is very healthy at the moment. Projects related to metro rail, airports, and roads have picked up across the country.', 'Even private-sector capex is starting to pick up in sectors like steel, cement and power. We are looking at a big capex cycle in India in the next few years.', 'The worst of rural slowdown seems to be over. Given the rains in the month of July, barring some geographies, it now seems to be under control. This should lead to better rural demand in the second half of the year.', 'In the next 2-3 quarters there are quite a few states and general elections. This should lead to a good uptick in demand from rural India. Sowing has been good and demand from Rural India has already stopped decelerating giving confidence that the worst of the slowdown is now behind.', 'Commodity price pressure has eased up quite a bit. The commodities whose prices had gone up post covid and then due to geo-political reasons, they have already either corrected quite a bit or are correcting. Hence, the pressure on margins for the companies which use these commodities has started to ease. Some of it will be passed on so as to get better volume growth, rest will actually go back to enhancing margins.', 'The Federal Reserve just hiked the policy rates. Going forward, it suggested that any more hikes will be data-dependent. The US CPI print is already around 3 percent. We believe that there is a possibility of a maximum of one more rate hike in this calendar year and that will likely be the peak for the interest rates from the Feds. Thereafter, we expect an extended pause or a gradual softening of interest rates.']",negative,finance

We filed a return on July 25, this week again some new information has come in,” says Mumbai-based chartered accountant Mehul Sheth.', 'At any given time,\xa0some information was not captured or there was duplicity in information. “The information on shares is reported by the broker and again NSDL (National Securities Depository Ltd) and CDSL (Central Depository Services Ltd). Joint property transactions are reported in both the names of the joint holders,” says another chartered accountant, Raju Shah.', '“At times, there is wrong reporting\xa0in AIS. Even after the returns are filed, you need to match the AIS again. If some ', ' mismatch gets reported due to a revision request in the other party’s AIS, then rectifications need to be made in your return too,” adds Shah.', 'Tax professionals told ', ' that due to such\xa0minor\xa0and\xa0major changes, their clients were insisting that they wait to file the returns. But they were told it was not possible to incorporate changes in the return during the short period before July 31.', 'These changes are the result of financial services firms updating their data based on their cycles. For instance, some banks have delayed TDS data, while some asset management companies have delayed sharing dividend information.', '“Brokers continue to feed capital gains information and if someone has deducted TDS for rent of more than Rs 50,000, they may file their return after your return has been submitted,” says Sheth.', 'Also read: ', 'Last week, Noida-based real estate broker Bisakha Durt received a call from her CA, asking for a particular bank account. She said the mentioned bank account had not been used for the last ten years and an application had already been made to close the account.

The information in the AIS is jumbled up and not mentioned year-wise. To complicate matters, individuals go by the bank data up to March 31. But the credits of interest, dividends are being made up to mid-April,” says Sheth.', 'To avoid underreporting of income tax, professionals confessed that they tried to match the details mentioned in the bank statement and the AIS and filled the higher of the two numbers into the returns to avoid tax complications.', 'Also Read: ', 'To avoid any major action, chartered accountants suggest that one files a revised return if any fresh and correct information emerges. “We expect a lot of revision of returns this year as we have filed the returns based on the details shared by the clients,” says Shah.', 'However, after revision of return too there could be chances of further follow up.', '“Even after you revise the income tax return, you could get an intimation by the assessing officer under Section 143 (1). Post processing of return, if there is a mismatch in the reported income and AIS, the department can send a notice under Section 148 (A) questioning you about the income that you have listed under the return,” Sheth says.', 'Also read:\xa0', 'Apart from verifying your returns electronically, now a system has been put in place to confirm or decline the information gathered against you.

Tax authorities generally outline the specific response procedures, which may include utilising an updated return option or following a normal response channel,” says Sujit Bangar, founder, Taxbuddy.com.', 'Carefully read the notice and mentioned instructions to determine the correct response method, as non-compliance may lead to delays or potential penalties. If you fail to respond to e-verification notice, the consequences could be “rejection of the tax return, potentially leading to further investigations, penalties (fines and additional interest) or audits. There could be increased scrutiny, including investigations into the taxpayer’s affairs, resulting in legal consequences too,” warns Bangar.', 'Chartered accountants also point out that the feedback mechanism for AIS that has been offered to individuals under the e-verification scheme offers limited options: information is correct, income is not taxable, income relates to another PAN or year and information is duplicate. There are no other options to file your feedback.', 'Troubled by the havoc caused due to e-verification, the Chartered Accountants Association, Ahmedabad, sent a representation to the Central Board of Direct Taxes in mid-July, asking them to streamline the process of e-verification.', '“We have asked the department to reduce the duplication of information and reduce the compliance burden on the taxpayers and consequential mismatch of data with the income tax return.

But apart from genuine refunds, fake links for getting refunds too are doing the rounds. A taxpayer shared a cybercrime instance where a verification link was sent to her via email. It turned out to be a fraud.', 'It is easy to mistake a fraudulent email as these days tax authorities prefer communication for sending notices or e-verification requests via email. But any notice or communication would be available for view in the “Pending actions” tab once you login to the online tax portals.', 'Additionally, to safeguard against fake links and potential scams, taxpayers should “verify the sender. Tax authorities typically use specific domain names or official email addresses. Avoid clicking on links within emails. Instead, manually enter the tax authority official website URL into the browser to mitigate phishing risks,” suggests Bangar.', ""Every notice has a DIN number too. Also, notices/letters (other than e-Verification Scheme, 2021 for FY 2020-21 and onwards) where the I-T department has some information on your transactions would have a DIN pre-fixed with 'Insight'.
